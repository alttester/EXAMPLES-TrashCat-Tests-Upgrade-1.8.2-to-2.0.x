# Setup for running on mobile device
Instrument the Android `TrashCat` application using the latest version of AltTester® Unity SDK - for additional information you can follow [this tutorial](https://alttester.com/walkthrough-tutorial-upgrading-trashcat-to-2-0-x/#Instrument%20TrashCat%20with%20AltTester%20Unity%20SDK%20v.2.0.x)

```
adb shell am force-stop com.Altom.TrashCat
```


### Run all tests from a specific class / file
